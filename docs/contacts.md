## Contact Workflows

Contacts typically follow a progression through different statuses as your relationship develops:

1. **New**: Recently added contacts that need initial follow-up
2. **Active**: Contacts you're actively engaging with
3. **Paused**: Temporarily inactive contacts
4. **Closed**: Contacts you're no longer pursuing
5. **Multiplying**: Contacts who are actively making new disciples

As you interact with a contact, update their status to reflect the current state of your relationship and track their faith journey progress.

You can customize your contact list view to display contacts grouped by their current status, making it easier to prioritize your ministry efforts.

## Understanding Display Name vs. Username

It's important to understand the difference between your display name and username:

- **Username**: Used for logging in and cannot be changed easily
- **Display Name**: How you appear to others in the system and can be updated at any time

## Why Display Names Matter

A clear, recognizable display name helps:

1. Team collaboration - colleagues can easily identify you
2. Contact management - contacts can see who they're assigned to
3. Activity tracking - your activities are properly attributed

Choose a display name that reflects how you want to be known within your Disciple.Tools community.

# Screenshots for Customizations Documentation

The images in this directory are used in the [Customizations Documentation](../../customizations.md).

## About the Screenshots

- If you're seeing placeholder images, it means the automatic screenshot generation couldn't capture the actual UI.
- To replace these with actual screenshots, login to your Disciple.Tools instance and capture the relevant screens manually.
- For each placeholder, see the corresponding .html and .txt files for descriptions of what should be captured.
